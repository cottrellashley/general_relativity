# general_relativity

(Note: All code was thought of and written by myself, as a self-learning project in python.)

In the General Relativity foulder, you will find:

1. Library: A class of widely used tensors, pre-defined for anyone who wished to use them. All arguments must be SymPy sympy.symbol objects.
I am constantly updating this by adding new tensors each day/week.

2. Objects: A class of the most important Tensors and Functions in General Relativity, all of which can be calculated from the Metric Tensor.

3. Tensors: This is a class which is more of a function like object. It's argument takes in two tensors in the form of sympy.array objects,
and performs tensor summating of indices in the order as per satted in the argument.
